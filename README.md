- We can see that vehicle length and ground clearance are the two main variables that affect MPG due to p values being under .05.
- With knowing that our p value is below .05 this also clearly shows us that the slope is not 0.
- At the bottom you can see our R-squared value is 0.7149 showing that our model is capable of predicting MechaCar prototype MPG.

- PSI variance comes to 62.29 which is accecptable for our 100lbs. PSI for all of the manufacturer lots.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

- After the t-test on the SuspesionPSI we got our p-value of 0.06028 and an alternative hypothesis that the true mean is not equal to 1500. Although this is suboptimal, the low p-value isnt too low.
