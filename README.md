-We can see that vehcile length and ground clearance are the to main variables that affect MPG due to p values being under .05.
-With knowing that our p value is below .05 this also clearly shows us that the slope is not 0.
-At the bottom you can see our R-squared value is 0.7149 and adjusted is 0.6825. This means that our model is capable of predicting MechaCar prototype MPG.
